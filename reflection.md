- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

Encapsulation made my code more organized by allowing each class to handle its own data and behavior. It helped me control access to variables through specific methods, which kept things secure and minimized unintended changes. Testing and debugging were easier because responsibilities were clearly divided between classes. However, writing accessors and mutators for everything felt like extra work at first. I also found debugging private attributes challenging since I couldn’t directly access the data when something went wrong. I learned that understand encapsulation, test classes separately, and only expose what’s necessary is important to keep the code clean and efficient.
